## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 9f7d6d3: Bound how long the brief model reasons before writing.

  Left unset, effort defaults to full depth, and on a full day's payload the
  model spent an entire token budget thinking and returned no brief at all. The
  judgement calls in a brief are modest — what to include, how to phrase it — and
  the facts now arrive pre-computed, so it does not need to deliberate at that
  length.

- a60866c: Cite the count when the data provides one.

  The rule forbidding hand-counted figures was read as a preference for vague
  ones, so a brief said "logged multiple flight lessons" where the aggregate said
  three. The point was never to avoid numbers, only to avoid invented ones.

- 650977e: Run memory extraction on the cheap model.

  It was using whichever model writes the brief, and since it is sent the same
  full payload, it cost roughly as much per day as the brief itself. Summarising
  data that has already been read is what the small model is for.

- 9978acb: Default the brief to Sonnet.

  It is the better fit for a job that runs unattended every morning: the accuracy
  work moved counting and identifiers out of the model's hands, so the extra
  reasoning of a larger model buys less here than it costs. Opus remains a
  one-line change in config.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ba2fbf: Read airports off the calendar instead of a list that goes stale.

  Aviation weather was fetched for whatever stations were configured once and
  never revisited, so the brief reported conditions for fields the household no
  longer flew from while the calendar plainly said where the flying was
  happening. The calendar connector now runs first when aviation weather is
  enabled, and any airport named in today's or the coming week's events is added
  to the weather request. Configured stations are still honoured — they're the
  home fields — and the behaviour can be turned off with `derive_stations:
false`.

  Identifiers are read literally from event text; `airport_aliases` maps place
  names to stations for fields whose events never spell out the identifier, and
  `activity_pattern` narrows the scan to events that actually imply flying.

  The hardcoded fallback that pointed the area forecast at one specific region
  when no ICAO station was configured is gone — the forecast is skipped instead.
  Validation now warns when a station looks like an IATA code, which returns no
  data rather than an error.

- b1fda2e: Make the brief accountable for the facts it states.

  A new `household` config section lists everyone the brief is about, including
  people who have no calendar, inbox or task list of their own. Previously the
  only people the brief knew were the ones with connector accounts, so a member
  without any was invisible and their events read as belonging to whoever's
  calendar carried them.

  The brief's date is now computed rather than written by the model, which had
  been pairing the right weekday with the next day's date on roughly one brief in
  six. A new top-level `timezone` setting anchors that date, the output
  filenames, the connector query windows and the scheduler to one zone, instead
  of filenames following UTC while the visible dates followed somewhere else.

  The prompt gains two rules: counts must be read from the structured
  per-person aggregates rather than tallied by hand, and airport or station
  identifiers must be copied from the payload rather than recalled. The
  self-critique gains a factual-accuracy category so a brief that reads well but
  states a wrong number is caught. Memory extraction no longer truncates
  mid-array — its output limit was too small, so most days' insights failed to
  parse and were silently dropped — and it no longer records counts, which go
  stale the day after they are written.

- aacbc77: Calendar events now carry per-person attribution and pre-computed counts.

  Each event lists the household member(s) whose calendar it came from, and an
  event appearing on two calendars is merged into one shared event that keeps
  both names rather than being deduplicated down to one person. The connector
  also emits an `aggregates` block with per-person totals for the recent, today
  and upcoming windows, plus optional per-category tallies driven by a new
  `event_categories` config option, so the brief cites counts instead of
  computing them.

  Alongside that: results are paginated (previously capped at one page, silently
  dropping events on busy calendars), per-calendar fetch failures are surfaced in
  the payload instead of only logged, query windows are bounded in the configured
  timezone rather than the process one, and `lookback_days` now defaults to 7 so
  past events are available on every run rather than only on the weekly review
  day.

### Patch Changes

- 25bdbc6: Give the brief enough token budget for models that reason before answering.

  Current models spend part of the response budget thinking, so the previous
  ceiling was consumed before the brief itself was written and every run ended
  in a truncated response.

- 1f51c34: Let the self-critique see the whole payload before it calls something wrong.

  The reviewer was shown a small slice of the day's data, so it reported
  anything past the cut as unsupported — and those false findings fed straight
  into the next day's prompt as faults to correct. It now receives the full
  payload, and is told that the recent and upcoming windows describe different
  periods, which was the other source of spurious findings.

- 987cb9b: Bump dev dependencies (eslint, prettier, jest, ts-jest, esbuild, @changesets/cli) and remove three redundant type assertions that the updated typescript-eslint now flags as unnecessary. Type-only change with no runtime effect.
- ea615ff: Refresh the model lineup and fix the usage pricing table.

  The shipped default was a model that has since been retired, and the setup
  script, web wizard and setup guide all still offered it. They now offer the
  current Sonnet and Opus.

  The pricing table priced Opus at three times its actual rate and had no entry
  for any current model, so an unrecognised model was silently billed at Sonnet
  rates. Rates are corrected, current models are listed, and an unlisted model is
  now estimated from its family with a note in the log rather than assumed.

- bf462b0: Upgrade the Anthropic SDK and stop mishandling unusual responses.

  The SDK was around eighteen months behind. Reading the response text assumed
  the first content block is always text and ignored `stop_reason` entirely, so
  a truncated or declined response surfaced as a JSON parse error — or, for the
  brief itself, as a generic "generation failed" page that said nothing about
  what actually went wrong. Text is now collected from all text blocks, and
  truncation and refusals are reported as themselves.

  The brief's output limit is also raised, since the previous ceiling was close
  enough to a long day's output to truncate it.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7754fce: Docker scheduled briefs can now print. The scheduler prints to the configured printer by default (set `PRINT_BRIEF=false` for UI-only deployments), the image bundles `cups-client` so `lp` can reach a CUPS server via `CUPS_SERVER`, and the build installs the toolchain needed to compile native modules (`better-sqlite3`) on alpine.

### Patch Changes

- 56dd858: Upgrade `@actual-app/api` to 26.5.2 so the budget connector stays in sync with newer Actual Budget server migrations (older client versions refuse to sync against an upgraded server).

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c6d7dca: Add vacation mode. Configure one or more `vacation` ranges in `config.yaml` (each with `start` / `end` as YYYY-MM-DD, inclusive on both ends, evaluated in your configured timezone) and the cron-driven scheduler will skip generation entirely on any date that falls inside a range. Manual CLI runs are unaffected, so on-demand briefs still work while you're away.

### Patch Changes

- 0eeaa2a: Fix CI test hang on Linux runners. The language connector test that exercised the `recordBriefPhrase` error path pointed `output_dir` at `/proc/invalid/...`; on macOS that errored fast, but on the GitHub Actions Ubuntu runner `mkdirSync({recursive:true})` against a `/proc` sub-path hung the worker indefinitely (the test job timed out at 47 minutes). Switch the failing path to a sub-path of a regular file so `mkdirSync` fails synchronously with `ENOTDIR` on every OS.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 19f3d38: Add `garbage_recycling` connector. Pure config-driven (no API), supports both weekly schedules (`weekly: thursday`) and biweekly schedules anchored to a known pickup date (`biweekly: { day: tuesday, anchor: "2026-04-21" }`). Surfaces today's and tomorrow's pickups so the brief can flag "bins out tonight" without you having to remember the alternating recycling week.
- 5695ddb: aviation_weather: expand to full preflight briefing.

  The connector used to return only METAR + TAF. It now fetches — in parallel,
  with graceful per-endpoint degradation — station info, PIREPs, SIGMETs,
  AIRMETs, G-AIRMETs (SIERRA/TANGO/ZULU), CWAs, and the local NWS Area
  Forecast Discussion, plus a computed density altitude report per station.

  Hazard polygons (SIGMET/AIRMET/G-AIRMET/CWA) are filtered to anything that
  contains or lies within 100 nm of a configured station, so the prompt
  payload stays tight. G-AIRMET forecast hours for the same hazard/product
  over the same stations are collapsed into a single report with a
  `forecastHours: [0, 3, 6, 9, 12]` array instead of five near-duplicates.

  New optional config fields: `wfo` (override the Area Forecast Discussion
  office), `pirep_radius_nm`, `pirep_age_hours`.

- e5387ee: Two improvements to fight recurring brief quality issues surfaced in a week of production critiques:
  - **Feedback loop surfaces RECURRING problems, not just raw examples.** `buildFeedbackContext` now classifies self-critique issues by category (Duplication, Verbosity, Missing data, Poor grouping, Stale items) and counts distinct days each category appears on. Any category hitting 3+ of the last 7 critique days gets a prominent "RECURRING quality problems" section with a specific remedy — not just a list of past gripes. Recent specific examples are still shown as anchors.
  - **System prompt: anti-conflation guardrail.** Added an explicit rule that shared sender, service, or vendor is NOT a semantic link. Prevents merging unrelated items from the same sender into one bullet when the underlying threads aren't actually connected.

- 3212e7b: ✨ Add language connector with 30-day phrase history so the brief's word-of-the-day never repeats

  The language word-of-the-day used to live in `extras:` and relied on the 7-day shared memory bucket for anti-repeat — which didn't work because phrases were never persisted as structured data. The new `language` connector:
  - Keeps its own phrase history file (`<output_dir>/language_history.json`) with a configurable retention window (default 30 days).
  - Feeds the full past-phrase list to the brief writer so it can dodge repeats deterministically.
  - Provides a rotating theme cue and level guidance, plus instructions to mine today's connector data for contextual vocab.
  - Parses the emitted phrase out of the brief after generation and appends it to history.

  Rendered as the last item in the Executive Brief section — not its own section — matching the original extras-based UX.

  Configure via `connectors.language` with `target_language`, `label_prefix`, `level`, and `history_days`.

- 3679545: Run connector fetches in parallel with per-connector deadlines. Previously each connector ran sequentially, so the daily brief took as long as the sum of all connector latencies (~10–30s). Now they run via `Promise.allSettled` and total fetch time is ~max instead of ~sum (typically 3–6× faster). Each fetch is wrapped in a configurable deadline (`connector_timeout_ms`, default 60s) so a single hanging connector can no longer stall the brief — it gets surfaced as an issue and the rest still complete. Result ordering is preserved.
- 6fa4443: Make connectors resilient to flaky upstreams and surface 52-week price
  extremes automatically.
  - Add `src/retry.ts`: shared exponential-backoff + jitter helper with a
    strict retriable-vs-terminal error taxonomy (5xx/408/429/aborts/timeouts/
    network errors retry; other 4xx don't). Replaces the silent
    `try { await fetch(...) } catch { return null }` pattern that used to drop
    whole connector payloads on a single upstream hiccup.
  - Wire the helper into `aviation_weather`, `todoist`, `weather`,
    `market`, and `actual_budget` with tuned retry budgets per API.
  - `market` now pulls a 1-year daily close series and emits
    `high52w` / `low52w` / `pctFromHigh52w` / `pctFromLow52w` plus boolean
    `atNear52wHigh` and `atNear52wLow` flags (within 0.5% of the trailing
    peak or trough). Connector description updated to tell the brief writer
    to always surface those flags — so an ATH can't be missed for a modest
    weekly change.
  - `actual_budget` init and sync calls retry on transient failures and
    stringify non-Error rejections (`{reason: 'x'}`) via `JSON.stringify`
    so brief errors no longer read "[object Object]".
  - `core.ts` gains `formatUnknownError` for the same purpose at the
    connector-issue boundary.

- 6109b83: Add a `sun_moon` connector that reports sunrise, sunset, solar noon, civil
  dawn/dusk, daylight hours, and moon phase/illumination/rise/set for a
  configured lat/lon. Pure local computation via `suncalc` — no API calls,
  never fails. Useful for VFR night currency boundary (end of civil twilight +
  1h), household-side sun timing (walks, golf), and moon-phase awareness for
  night flying or stargazing.
- 2ab8835: Add Week in Review mode. Configure `weekly_review_day` (a day name like
  `saturday` or a number 0-6) and on that day the brief is replaced by a
  retrospective covering the trailing 7 days, generated from a separate
  `src/prompts/weekly.md` system prompt with sections for The Week,
  Accomplishments, By the Numbers, Open Items, Notable, and Looking Ahead.
  The Google Calendar connector now supports `lookback_days` for fetching
  past events, and is automatically bumped to a 7-day lookback on review
  days so the retrospective has data to draw on.

### Patch Changes

- Fix Jest hang on CI by closing the `startServer` listener in its test and dropping the `forceExit` workaround. `startServer` now returns the underlying `http.Server` so callers (and tests) can shut it down cleanly.
- ab69530: Boost test coverage from 70% to 80%+ with new core.ts and runPipeline tests
- f5c43ce: Upgrade default brief model to Claude Opus 4.7 and register its pricing ($15 input / $75 output per M tokens) alongside the older Opus 4.x IDs in the usage tracker so cost accounting stays accurate across model rollovers.
- 37669ae: 🐛 Pre-compute weekday/date/time labels for calendar events so the brief writer can't mis-derive them

  Calendar events now carry `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `dayOfWeek` (e.g. "Monday"), `timeLabel` ("7:30 AM" or null for all-day), and `whenLabel` ("today", "tomorrow", "Monday (in 4 days)") fields resolved in the configured timezone. The connector also emits the timezone and today's date alongside the events. This closes a prior bug where the LLM was labeling events with the wrong weekday (off by one) when deriving weekdays from raw ISO strings.

- a6b981b: Enforce 95% test coverage threshold and boost coverage to 99%+ lines across all files
- 4aec9f9: Forbid compound topic mashing in Executive Brief items. Each bullet now covers exactly one subject — no more cramming unrelated facts into one bullet just because they share a person, source, or rough timeframe.
- 0a12fcd: Fix actual_budget connector ENOENT on volatile /tmp: mkdir -p the cache dir before init, so the connector keeps working after the OS clears /tmp
- 8a2a2b7: Fix two cron crash vectors: actual-budget background task race condition and unhandled API errors in pipeline
- 62694f0: Two parser reliability fixes observed in the past week of production briefs:
  - `stripJsonCodeFences` now tolerates leading/trailing commentary around the fenced block. Previously the anchored regex failed whenever Haiku added a trailing sentence after ` ```json\n[]\n``` `, which silently broke auto-close task detection every day.
  - `aviation_weather` treats a 200 with an empty body as a legitimate nothing-to-report response (common for quiet PIREP/CWA windows) rather than logging `Unexpected end of JSON input`. Truly unparseable bodies still log a distinct warning.

- a7c0953: Fix prettier formatting in core.ts
- e540617: Fix a TypeScript narrowing error in the garbage_recycling validate path so a
  schedule object with neither `weekly` nor `biweekly` reports a clean
  "missing 'weekly' or 'biweekly'" check instead of failing to compile.
- 259986d: Tighten two system prompt rules: clarify that the "one topic per item" rule allows multiple actions on the _same_ subject (e.g. "garage the car, salt the steps" is one snow-prep topic), and add concrete examples to the dollar-amount hallucination guard so order numbers, tracking IDs, and confirmation codes are clearly distinguished from real money.
- d71273b: Extract `stripJsonCodeFences` helper in core.ts. Replaces 4 copy-pasted regex sites that strip Markdown code fences from Claude responses, with a single tested utility.
- 5953f28: 🐛 Strengthen system prompt so the brief writer uses pre-computed calendar fields

  A prior change pre-computed `dayOfWeek` / `date` / `whenLabel` on each calendar event, but the brief writer was still occasionally deriving the weekday from raw ISO strings and getting it wrong. The system prompt now explicitly tells it to use those fields verbatim and never derive weekdays itself. Also teaches it how to surface the `language` connector's phrase inside the Executive Brief.

- 4aec9f9: Add hallucination guard: forbid extracting dollar amounts from email free-text. Order numbers, tracking IDs, and confirmation codes are no longer mistaken for paid amounts.
- 24c313c: Scrub personal data from tracked files. Replaces real names, vendor names, and trip destinations in prompt examples, README, config example, mock brief, and test fixtures with generic placeholders.
- 4aec9f9: Email Highlights now skips resolved/no-action threads. "Thanks, fixed it" follow-ups no longer take up space in the brief.
- a4d9087: Fix cron reliability: catch async crashes from @actual-app/api, add retry with backoff for Claude API calls, and generate error briefs when all retries fail
- 61524d5: Week in Review: switch from full-brief replacement to a small supplemental blurb.

  Previously, on `weekly_review_day` the entire daily brief was replaced with a
  dedicated Week in Review retrospective. That turned out to be way too much —
  a 7-day retrospective crowding out the actually useful daily content.

  Now the daily brief runs as usual and is prepended with a compact Week in
  Review section (2–4 sentences, ~60 words) as the first section of the brief.
  The dedicated weekly prompt file has been removed. The calendar lookback is
  still auto-bumped to 7 days on review days so the blurb has past events to
  reference.

- 2946efe: Actual Budget connector now emits `weekOverWeekByCategory` for trend-based spending insights, and the system prompt steers Claude away from raw "X% over budget" framing toward week-over-week anomalies and unusually large transactions.
